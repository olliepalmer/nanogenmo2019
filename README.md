# nanogenmo2019

My attempt at a NaNoGenMo entry this year: a directory of fictional companies.

All the code you need to run this is in the `2019.12.02 NaNoGenMo workbook.ipynb`

A web version of sample outputs is online [here](https://github.com/olliepalmer/directorydirectory), and should soon be running at [directorydirectory.netlify.com](https://directorydirectory.netlify.com).
