## Directory Directory

A directory made for nanogenmo 2019. Source code is in another repo (will link soon) – this is just the Jekyll website repo, which uses the Just the Docs theme.

The repo with code to make this site is [here](https://github.com/olliepalmer/nanogenmo2019), and the site running the code from this repo you're looking at now is at [directorydirectory.netlify.com](directorydirectory.netlify.com). It may or may not be live.
